This blog post is work in progress. The following are the contributions of members of the GIScience group to the EGU 2022 conference. Abstracts with associated papers are highlighted more prominently.


## Geospatial machine learning methodology

[Brenning: Novel approaches to model assessment and interpretation in geospatial machine learning](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-6955.html)

- Associated blog posts: (1) [spatial model assessment](https://geods.netlify.app/post/spatial-ml-model-diagnostics/), (2) [model interpretation in transformed space](https://geods.netlify.app/post/interpretable-ml-with-a-twist/)
- Associated preprints in arXiv: (1) [spatial model assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08478), (2) [model interpretation in transformed space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04295)
- Associated R package for model interpretation in transformed space, [wiml](https://github.com/alexanderbrenning/wiml)


## Natural hazards and Earth surface processes

[Goetz et al.: Modelling debris-flow source-area connectivity and impacted stream channels in the semi-arid central Andes of Chile using random walks and network analysis](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-7596.html)

- Associated Github repo [sedconnect](https://github.com/jngtz/sedconnect)
- Related earlier journal paper in [NHESS](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/21/2543/2021/), associated Github repo with [R package runoptGPP](https://github.com/jngtz/runoptGPP), and [non-technical summary (in German)](https://www.chemgeo.uni-jena.de/das-risiko-von-schlammlawinen-beherrschen)


[Maraun et al. (with R. Knevels and A. Brenning): A severe landslide event in the Alpine foreland under possible future climate and land-use changes](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-7465.html)

- Associated [Nature blog post](https://earthenvironmentcommunity.nature.com/posts/climate-change-may-amplify-the-landslide-hazard-in-the-forelands-of-the-european-alps)
- Associated journal article in [*Comm. Earth Env.*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00408-7)


[Wang & Brenning: Combining active-learning approaches with support vector machines for landslide mapping](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-1478.html)

- Active learning is a machine-learning strategy that aims to reduce the amount of training data required, directing the labeling expert to the most 'relevant' locations. We demonstrate the potential of this approach for landslide mapping.
- Associated journal paper in [*Remote Sensing*](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/13/2588)
